    "input": "Study1: Therapy in type 2 diabetes: insulin glargine vs. NPH insulin both in combination with glimepiride. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients often fail to achieve adequate glycemic control with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Insulin has been shown to improve glycemic control in these patients but with increased risk of hypoglycemia. This study compared the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine and NPH insulin, both in combination with a once-daily fixed dose of glimepiride, in terms of glycemic control and incidence of hypoglycemia.                 In this open-label, 24-week randomized trial in ten Latin American countries, T2DM patients poorly controlled on OADs (HbA1c > or = 7.5 and < or = 10.5%) received glimepiride plus insulin glargine (n = 231) or NPH insulin (n = 250) using a forced titration algorithm. The primary endpoint was the equivalence of 24-week mean changes in HbA1c.                 Insulin glargine and NPH insulin achieved similar HbA1c reductions (adjusted mean difference -0.047; 90% CI -0.232, 0.138; per-protocol analysis). Confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly lower with insulin glargine vs. NPH insulin (16.9 vs. 30.0%; p <0.01; safety analysis). Patients receiving insulin glargine were significantly more likely to achieve HbA1c levels < 7.0% without hypoglycemia (27 vs. 17%; p = 0.014; per-protocol analysis). There was a more pronounced treatment satisfaction improvement with insulin glargine vs. NPH insulin (p <0.02; full analysis). The proportion of patients who lost time from work or normal activities due to diabetes was lower with insulin glargine vs. NPH (1.8 vs. 3.3%; full analysis).                 In patients with T2DM, inadequately controlled on OADs, once-daily insulin glargine plus glimepiride is effective in improving metabolic control with a reduced incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin.\nStudy2: Insulin glargine or NPH combined with metformin in type 2 diabetes: the LANMET study. In type 2 diabetic patients we compared 9 months of combination therapy with insulin glargine and metformin with 9 months of NPH insulin combined with metformin. The primary focus was changes in HbA(1c); secondary focus was diurnal glucose profiles and symptomatic hypoglycaemia.                 In this investigator-initiated open, parallel-group clinical trial involving seven centres, 110 insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control (HbA(1c) >or=8.0%) on oral hypoglycaemic agents (90% using sulfonylurea plus metformin) were randomised to receive bedtime insulin glargine with metformin (G+MET) or bedtime NPH with metformin (NPH+MET) for 36 weeks. The patients were taught how to self-adjust their insulin dose and use a modem to send the results of home glucose monitoring to treatment centres. The goal was to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 4.0 to 5.5 mmol/l in both groups.                 During the last 12 weeks, FPGs averaged 5.75+/-0.02 and 5.96+/-0.03 mmol/l (p<0.001) and insulin doses were 68+/-5 and 70+/-6 IU/day (0.69+/-0.05 and 0.66+/-0.04 IU kg(-1) day(-1), NS) in the G+MET and NPH+MET groups, respectively. At 36 weeks, mean HbA(1c) was 7.14+/-0.12 and 7.16+/-0.14%, respectively (NS). Symptomatic, but not confirmed symptomatic, hypoglycaemia was significantly lower during the first 12 weeks in the G+MET group (4.1+/-0.8 episodes/patient-year) than in the NPH+MET group (9.0+/-2.3 episodes/patient-year, p<0.05), but not significantly different thereafter. Glucose levels before dinner were higher in the NPH+MET group (10.1+/-0.3 mmol/l) than in the G+MET group (8.6+/-0.3 mmol/l, p=0.002) throughout the 36-week study. With regard to baseline characteristics such as initial glycaemia or C-peptide, there was no difference between patients who achieved good glycaemic control (HbA(1c) <7.0%) and those who did not. Differences were seen in the following: between study centres, weight gain during the run-in period and insulin therapy, and FPG during the last 12 weeks (5.7+/-0.2 vs 6.7+/-0.3 mmol/l for patients reaching vs those not reaching target, p<0.01).                 Good glycaemic control can be achieved with both G+MET and NPH+MET. Use of G+MET reduces symptomatic hypoglycaemia during the first 12 weeks and dinner time hyperglycaemia compared with NPH+MET.\nStudy3: Lower within-subject variability of fasting blood glucose and reduced weight gain with insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a basal-bolus insulin regimen comprising either insulin detemir or neural protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin in combination with mealtime insulin aspart in patients with type 2 diabetes.                 This was a 26-week, multinational, open-label, parallel group trial with 505 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age, 60.4 +/- 8.6 years; mean BMI, 30.4 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2); mean HbA(1c), 7.9 +/- 1.3%). Patients, randomized 2:1 to insulin detemir or NPH insulin, received basal insulin either once or twice daily according to their pretrial insulin treatment and insulin aspart at mealtimes.                 After 26 weeks of treatment, significant reductions in HbA(1c) were observed for insulin detemir (0.2%-points, p = 0.004) and NPH insulin (0.4%-points; p = 0.0001); HbA(1c) levels were comparable at study end (insulin detemir, 7.6%; NPH insulin, 7.5%). The number of basal insulin injections administered per day had no effect on HbA(1c) levels (p = 0.50). Nine-point self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) profiles were similar for the two treatment groups (p = 0.58), as were reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (insulin detemir, 0.5 mmol/l; NPH insulin, 0.6 mmol/l). At study end, FPG concentrations were similar for the two treatment groups (p = 0.66). By contrast, within-subject day-to-day variation in fasting SMBG was significantly lower with insulin detemir (p = 0.021). Moreover, patients receiving insulin detemir gained significantly less body weight than those who were administered NPH insulin (1.0 and 1.8 kg, respectively, p = 0.017). The frequency of adverse events and the risk of hypoglycaemia were comparable for the two treatment groups.                 Patients with type 2 diabetes, treated for 26 weeks with insulin detemir plus insulin aspart at mealtimes, experienced comparable glycaemic control but significantly lower within-subject variability and less weight gain compared to patients treated with NPH insulin and insulin aspart. Insulin detemir was well tolerated and had a similar safety profile to NPH insulin.\n",
    "output": "Conclusions: Our analysis suggests, if at all only a minor clinical benefit of treatment with long-acting insulin analogues for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 treated with \"basal\" insulin regarding symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. Until long-term efficacy and safety data are available, we suggest a cautious approach to therapy with insulin glargine or detemir."

    "input": "Study1: Auricular acupuncture for dental anxiety: a randomized controlled trial. Auricular acupuncture can be an effective treatment for acute anxiety, but there is a lack of direct comparisons of acupuncture to proven standard drug treatments. In this study we compared the efficacy of auricular acupuncture with intranasal midazolam, placebo acupuncture, and no treatment for reducing dental anxiety. Patients having dental extractions (n = 67) were randomized to (i) auricular acupuncture, (ii) placebo acupuncture, and (iii) intranasal midazolam and compared with a no treatment group. Anxiety was assessed before the interventions, at 30 min, and after the dental extraction. Physiological variables were assessed continuously. With the no treatment group as control, the auricular acupuncture group, and the midazolam group were significantly less anxious at 30 min as compared with patients in the placebo acupuncture group (Spielberger Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory X1, P = 0.012 and <0.001, respectively). In addition, patient compliance assessed by the dentist was significantly improved if auricular acupuncture or application of intranasal midazolam had been performed (P = 0.032 and 0.049, respectively). In conclusion, both, auricular acupuncture and intranasal midazolam were similarly effective for the treatment of dental anxiety.\nStudy2: The effects of applied tension on symptoms in French-speaking blood donors: a randomized trial. Blood-donation-related symptoms such as dizziness and weakness discourage people from participating in this important health-related activity. Four hundred sixty-seven young adult, French-speaking blood donors were randomly assigned to (a) a condition in which they learned a possible preventive technique called applied tension and were asked to practice it from the time they got on the donation chair until they were just about to get up, (b) a placebo condition in which they learned applied tension and were asked to practice it from the time they got on the chair until the insertion of the donation needle, or (c) a no-treatment control condition. Donors assigned to the treatment condition reported significantly fewer blood-donation-related symptoms than did donors assigned to the other conditions and rated their likelihood of returning to give blood again as greater than did those in the no treatment condition. Among donors whose chairs were not reclined, participants in the treatment condition had significantly smaller heart rate reactions to blood donation than did those in the other conditions.                 2006 APA, all rights reserved\nStudy3: The effect of high and low frequency electroacupuncture in pain after lower abdominal surgery. In the present study, we examined the effects of preoperative electroacupuncture (EA) at classical bilateral acupuncture points (Zusanli, also known as ST-36) on postoperative pain and opioid-related side effects. One hundred healthy consenting women undergoing lower abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to four treatment regimens: Group I (n=25), control; Group II (n=25), sham-EA (needle insertion without electrical stimulation); Group III (n=25), low-EA (2 Hz of electrical stimulation); and Group IV (n=25), high-EA (100 Hz of electrical stimulation). EA groups received needle insertion with or without electrical stimulation 20 min prior to anesthesia. All patients received patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) of morphine postoperation. Postoperative pain was evaluated by recording (1). the time of the first required analgesic, (2). the number of PCA demands, (3). the total amount of morphine required by PCA, and (4) patients' VAS pain score. We found that the time of first analgesic requested was 10, 18, 28, and 28 min in the control, sham-, low-, and high-EA groups, respectively. During the first 24h, the total amount of morphine required was decreased by 21, 43 and 61% in the sham-, low- and high-EA groups, respectively. The incidence of nausea and dizziness during the first 24h after surgery was significantly reduced in both the low-EA and high-EA groups compared with the control and sham-EA groups. We also found that sham-EA exerts a beneficial effect with respect to its pain relieving quality but not the side effect profiles. Our findings demonstrates that preoperative treatment with low-EA and high-EA can reduce postoperative analgesic requirements and associated side effects in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery.\nStudy4: Expectancy, false galvanic skin response feedback, and systematic desensitization in the modification of phobic behavior. nan\nStudy5: Stress management training for hypertensives: cognitive and physiological effects. The contribution of training procedures designed to alter individuals' psychological responses to stressful life stimuli to the reduction of blood-pressure levels of hypertensives was evaluated. The treatment consisted of a set of coping skill-building experiences. Forty-one black males, mildly to moderately hypertensive and under medical supervision in an outpatient cardiovascular unit of a veterans' hospital, participated. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Cognitive Self-Management Training (CSM), Attention Placebo Control, and Current Clinic Conditions Control. The dependent measures were the State Anxiety Scale, Trait Anxiety Scale, Coping Strategic Inventory, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Subjects in the CSM group reported significant increases in the use of cognitive coping strategies in their lives and demonstrated significant decreases in measured levels of state anxiety and systolic blood pressure. Promising reductions of diastolic blood pressure ratings were obtained as well.\nStudy6: A controlled study of reserpine on chronically disturbed patients. nan\nStudy7: Home based exercise programme for knee pain and knee osteoarthritis: randomised controlled trial. To determine whether a home based exercise programme can improve outcomes in patients with knee pain.                 Pragmatic, factorial randomised controlled trial of two years' duration.                 Two general practices in Nottingham.                 786 men and women aged >/=45 years with self reported knee pain. Interventions: Participants were randomised to four groups to receive exercise therapy, monthly telephone contact, exercise therapy plus telephone contact, or no intervention. Patients in the no intervention and combined exercise and telephone groups were randomised to receive or not receive a placebo health food tablet.                 Primary outcome was self reported score for knee pain on the Western Ontario and McMaster universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index at two years. Secondary outcomes included knee specific physical function and stiffness (scored on WOMAC index), general physical function (scored on SF-36 questionnaire), psychological outlook (scored on hospital anxiety and depression scale), and isometric muscle strength.                 600 (76.3%) participants completed the study. At 24 months, highly significant reductions in knee pain were apparent for the pooled exercise groups compared with the non-exercise groups (mean difference -0.82, 95% confidence interval -1.3 to -0.3). Similar improvements were observed at 6, 12, and 18 months. Regular telephone contact alone did not reduce pain. The reduction in pain was greater the closer patients adhered to the exercise plan.                 A simple home based exercise programme can significantly reduce knee pain. The lack of improvement in patients who received only telephone contact suggests that improvements are not just due to psychosocial effects because of contact with the therapist.\nStudy8: Paradoxical intention and insomnia: an experimental investigation. nan\nStudy9: Cognitive-behavior therapy with adult patients with epilepsy: a controlled outcome study. The present study evaluated the efficacy of group cognitive-behavior therapy for the alleviation of psychosocial problems and reduction of seizures with adult epileptic patients. Twenty-seven outpatients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Cognitive-Behavior Therapy, Supportive Counseling (attention-placebo control), and Waiting list (no treatment control). The major outcome measures used were: patient's, neurologist's, and therapist's global ratings of psychological adjustment, patient's target complaints and weekly seizure frequency, patient's and neurologist's ratings of seizure control, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory. No significant differences were found among the three groups on these measures except for therapist's global ratings of psychological adjustment, on which both the Cognitive-Behavior Therapy and Supportive Counseling groups improved significantly after therapy, but the Waiting List control group did not. Overall, little support was found for the efficacy of group cognitive behavior therapy (eight 2-h weekly sessions) for the reduction of psychosocial difficulties or seizures. Implications of the present findings are discussed, with the need for further controlled outcome research stressed.\nStudy10: Randomised trial of analgesic effects of sucrose, glucose, and pacifiers in term neonates. To assess and compare the analgesic effects of orally administered glucose and sucrose and pacifiers. To determine the synergistic analgesic effect of sucrose and pacifiers.                 Randomised prospective study with validated behavioural acute pain rating scale.                 Maternity ward.                 150 term newborns undergoing venepuncture randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: no treatment; placebo (2 ml sterile water); 2 ml 30% glucose; 2 ml 30% sucrose; a pacifier; and 2 ml 30% sucrose followed by a pacifier.                 Median (interquartile) pain scores during venepuncture were 7 (5-10) for no treatment; 7 (6-10) for placebo (sterile water); 5 (3-7) for 30% glucose; 5 (2-8) for 30% sucrose; 2 (1-4) for pacifier; and 1 (1-2) for 30% sucrose plus pacifier. Mann-Whitney U test P values for comparisons of 30% glucose, 30% sucrose, pacifier, and 30% sucrose plus pacifier versus placebo (sterile water) were 0.005, 0.01, <0.0001, and <0.0001, respectively. Differences between group median pain scores for these comparisons were 2 (95% confidence interval 1 to 4), 2 (0 to 4), 5 (4 to 7), and 6 (5 to 8), respectively. P values for comparisons of 30% glucose, 30% sucrose, and 30% sucrose plus pacifier versus pacifier were 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.06, respectively. Differences between group medians for these comparisons were 3 (2 to 5), 3 (1 to 5), and 1 (0 to 2), respectively.                 The analgesic effects of concentrated sucrose and glucose and pacifiers are clinically apparent in newborns, pacifiers being more effective than sweet solutions. The association of sucrose and pacifier showed a trend towards lower scores compared with pacifiers alone. These simple and safe interventions should be widely used for minor procedures in neonates.\n",
    "output": "Conclusions: We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important. Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed."

    "input": "Study: Outpatient vs hospital methadone detoxification: an experimental comparison. This study compares the effectiveness and cost of hospital narcotic detoxificationand outpatient narcotic detoxification using methadone. Forty heroin addicts seeking narcotic withdrawal were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Methadone treatment was planned for no longer than 10 days while psychiatric supportive services were made available to continue as needed. The results suggest little benefit from either treatment approach and there was no significant differences between the treatments. Only a few patients achieved a drug-free state, and of those who did, all but one had returned to use of narcotics within 2 months. The data indicate that detoxification using methadone is a palliative procedure. The cost of outpatient detoxification can be accomplished for approximately one-tenth the cost of inhospital treatment without significantlyaltering the effectiveness of treatment.\n",

In type 2 diabetic patients we compared 9 months of combination therapy with insulin glargine and metformin with 9 months of NPH insulin combined with metformin. The primary focus was changes in HbA(1c); secondary focus was diurnal glucose profiles and symptomatic hypoglycaemia.

The patients were taught how to self-adjust their insulin dose and use a modem to send the results of home glucose monitoring to treatment centres. The goal was to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 4.0 to 5.5 mmol/l in both groups.                 During the last 12 weeks, FPGs averaged 5.75+/-0.02 and 5.96+/-0.03 mmol/l (p<0.001) and insulin doses were 68+/-5 and 70+/-6 IU/day (0.69+/-0.05 and 0.66+/-0.04 IU kg(-1) day(-1), NS) in the G+MET and NPH+MET groups, respectively. At 36 weeks, mean HbA(1c) was 7.14+/-0.12 and 7.16+/-0.14%, respectively (NS). Symptomatic, but not confirmed symptomatic, hypoglycaemia was significantly lower during the first 12 weeks in the G+MET group (4.1+/-0.8 episodes/patient-year) than in the NPH+MET group (9.0+/-2.3 episodes/patient-year, p<0.05), but not significantly different thereafter.

With regard to baseline characteristics such as initial glycaemia or C-peptide, there was no difference between patients who achieved good glycaemic control (HbA(1c) <7.0%) and those who did not. Differences were seen in the following: between study centres, weight gain during the run-in period and insulin therapy, and FPG during the last 12 weeks (5.7+/-0.2 vs 6.7+/-0.3 mmol/l for patients reaching vs those not reaching target, p<0.01).                 Good glycaemic control can be achieved with both G+MET and NPH+MET. Use of G+MET reduces symptomatic hypoglycaemia during the first 12 weeks and dinner time hyperglycaemia compared with NPH+MET.\nStudy3: Lower within-subject variability of fasting blood glucose and reduced weight gain with insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a basal-bolus insulin regimen comprising either insulin detemir or neural protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin in combination with mealtime insulin aspart in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Patients with type 2 diabetes, treated for 26 weeks with insulin detemir plus insulin aspart at mealtimes, experienced comparable glycaemic control but significantly lower within-subject variability and less weight gain compared to patients treated with NPH insulin and insulin aspart. Insulin detemir was well tolerated and had a similar safety profile to NPH insulin.\n",

EA groups received needle insertion with or without electrical stimulation 20 min prior to anesthesia. All patients received patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) of morphine postoperation. Postoperative pain was evaluated by recording (1). the time of the first required analgesic, (2). the number of PCA demands, (3). the total amount of morphine required by PCA, and (4) patients' VAS pain score. We found that the time of first analgesic requested was 10, 18, 28, and 28 min in the control, sham-, low-, and high-EA groups, respectively. During the first 24h, the total amount of morphine required was decreased by 21, 43 and 61% in the sham-, low- and high-EA groups, respectively. The incidence of nausea and dizziness during the first 24h after surgery was significantly reduced in both the low-EA and high-EA groups compared with the control and sham-EA groups. We also found that sham-EA exerts a beneficial effect with respect to its pain relieving quality but not the side effect profiles. Our findings demonstrates that preoperative treatment with low-EA and high-EA can reduce postoperative analgesic requirements and associated side effects in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery.\nStudy4: Expectancy, false galvanic skin response feedback, and systematic desensitization in the modification of phobic behavior. nan\nStudy5: Stress management training for hypertensives: cognitive and physiological effects. The contribution of training procedures designed to alter individuals' psychological responses to stressful life stimuli to the reduction of blood-pressure levels of hypertensives was evaluated. The treatment consisted of a set of coping skill-building experiences. Forty-one black males, mildly to moderately hypertensive and under medical supervision in an outpatient cardiovascular unit of a veterans' hospital, participated. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Cognitive Self-Management Training (CSM), Attention Placebo Control, and Current Clinic Conditions Control. The dependent measures were the State Anxiety Scale, Trait Anxiety Scale, Coping Strategic Inventory, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Subjects in the CSM group reported significant increases in the use of cognitive coping strategies in their lives and demonstrated significant decreases in measured levels of state anxiety and systolic blood pressure. Promising reductions of diastolic blood pressure ratings were obtained as well.\nStudy6: A controlled study of reserpine on chronically disturbed patients. nan\nStudy7: Home based exercise programme for knee pain and knee osteoarthritis: randomised controlled trial. To determine whether a home based exercise programme can improve outcomes in patients with knee pain.                 Pragmatic, factorial randomised controlled trial of two years' duration.                 Two general practices in Nottingham.                 786 men and women aged >/=45 years with self reported knee pain. Interventions: Participants were randomised to four groups to receive exercise therapy, monthly telephone contact, exercise therapy plus telephone contact, or no intervention. Patients in the no intervention and combined exercise and telephone groups were randomised to receive or not receive a placebo health food tablet.                 Primary outcome was self reported score for knee pain on the Western Ontario and McMaster universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index at two years. Secondary outcomes included knee specific physical function and stiffness (scored on WOMAC index), general physical function (scored on SF-36 questionnaire), psychological outlook (scored on hospital anxiety and depression scale), and isometric muscle strength.                 600 (76.3%) participants completed the study. At 24 months, highly significant reductions in knee pain were apparent for the pooled exercise groups compared with the non-exercise groups (mean difference -0.82, 95% confidence interval -1.3 to -0.3). Similar improvements were observed at 6, 12, and 18 months. Regular telephone contact alone did not reduce pain. The reduction in pain was greater the closer patients adhered to the exercise plan.                 A simple home based exercise programme can significantly reduce knee pain. The lack of improvement in patients who received only telephone contact suggests that improvements are not just due to psychosocial effects because of contact with the therapist.\nStudy8: Paradoxical intention and insomnia: an experimental investigation. nan\nStudy9: Cognitive-behavior therapy with adult patients with epilepsy: a controlled outcome study. The present study evaluated the efficacy of group cognitive-behavior therapy for the alleviation of psychosocial problems and reduction of seizures with adult epileptic patients. Twenty-seven outpatients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Cognitive-Behavior Therapy, Supportive Counseling (attention-placebo control), and Waiting list (no treatment control). The major outcome measures used were: patient's, neurologist's, and therapist's global ratings of psychological adjustment, patient's target complaints and weekly seizure frequency, patient's and neurologist's ratings of seizure control, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory. No significant differences were found among the three groups on these measures except for therapist's global ratings of psychological adjustment, on which both the Cognitive-Behavior Therapy and Supportive Counseling groups improved significantly after therapy, but the Waiting List control group did not. Overall, little support was found for the efficacy of group cognitive behavior therapy (eight 2-h weekly sessions) for the reduction of psychosocial difficulties or seizures. Implications of the present findings are discussed, with the need for further controlled outcome research stressed.\nStudy10: Randomised trial of analgesic effects of sucrose, glucose, and pacifiers in term neonates. To assess and compare the analgesic effects of orally administered glucose and sucrose and pacifiers. To determine the synergistic analgesic effect of sucrose and pacifiers.                 Randomised prospective study with validated behavioural acute pain rating scale.                 Maternity ward.                 150 term newborns undergoing venepuncture randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups: no treatment; placebo (2 ml sterile water); 2 ml 30% glucose; 2 ml 30% sucrose; a pacifier; and 2 ml 30% sucrose followed by a pacifier.                 Median (interquartile) pain scores during venepuncture were 7 (5-10) for no treatment; 7 (6-10) for placebo (sterile water); 5 (3-7) for 30% glucose; 5 (2-8) for 30% sucrose; 2 (1-4) for pacifier; and 1 (1-2) for 30% sucrose plus pacifier. Mann-Whitney U test P values for comparisons of 30% glucose, 30% sucrose, pacifier, and 30% sucrose plus pacifier versus placebo (sterile water) were 0.005, 0.01, <0.0001, and <0.0001, respectively. Differences between group median pain scores for these comparisons were 2 (95% confidence interval 1 to 4), 2 (0 to 4), 5 (4 to 7), and 6 (5 to 8), respectively. P values for comparisons of 30% glucose, 30% sucrose, and 30% sucrose plus pacifier versus pacifier were 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.06, respectively. Differences between group medians for these comparisons were 3 (2 to 5), 3 (1 to 5), and 1 (0 to 2), respectively.                 The analgesic effects of concentrated sucrose and glucose and pacifiers are clinically apparent in newborns, pacifiers being more effective than sweet solutions. The association of sucrose and pacifier showed a trend towards lower scores compared with pacifiers alone. These simple and safe interventions should be widely used for minor procedures in neonates.\n",
Output: "Conclusions: We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important. Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed."
Case 3: Input: "Study: Outpatient vs hospital methadone detoxification: an experimental comparison. This study compares the effectiveness and cost of hospital narcotic detoxificationand outpatient narcotic detoxification using methadone. Forty heroin addicts seeking narcotic withdrawal were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Methadone treatment was planned for no longer than 10 days while psychiatric supportive services were made available to continue as needed. The results suggest little benefit from either treatment approach and there was no significant differences between the treatments. Only a few patients achieved a drug-free state, and of those who did, all but one had returned to use of narcotics within 2 months. The data indicate that detoxification using methadone is a palliative procedure. The cost of outpatient detoxification can be accomplished for approximately one-tenth the cost of inhospital treatment without significantlyaltering the effectiveness of treatment.\n",
Output: "Conclusions: This review demonstrates that there is no good available research to guide the clinician about the outcomes or cost-effectiveness of inpatient or outpatient approaches to opioid detoxification."
